# Digital to Analog Converter

The DAC we've chosen is an ESS Sabre ES9020. This is the third of three choices originally. There's two other options we considered including the Asahi AK4432VT and ES9039Q2M also from Sabre. The former is a cheaper option that is better documented and more likely to remain in production for longer, while the latter is just a much mroe powerful DAC if either the Sabre or Asahi don't really fit our needs for clarity.

## Interface

To communicate with the DAC, we're going to take advantage of the MCU's SAI
