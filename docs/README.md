# Lemon (?) Player

Goal is to design and publish an open-source framework for an audio player that is both affordable and powerful including schematics, 3D models, and firmware.

This is being designed to our requirements and needs so all limitations are within what we consider "the device".

Outlined in this repo will be documents containing all our research for whatever we need in order to get this thing put together and running.

# Top-Level Requirements

- STM32-based
- Performance on-par if not better-than the iPod 5th Gen
- Decently powerful DAC output
- Power-efficient
- Light
- Hotswappable battery
- USB-C
- microSD SDXC support
- Physical HOLD switch
- Gesture navigation and controls *as well as* switch controls
- Light system firmware
- Simple UNIX-like software

## NUDs (New Unique Designs)

The following are all technical items that are determining (and have determined) our choice for MCU.
